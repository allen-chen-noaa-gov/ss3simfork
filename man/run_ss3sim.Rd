\title{Master function to run SS3 simulations}
\usage{
run_ss3sim(iterations, scenarios, case_folder, om_dir, em_dir,
  case_files = list(F = "F", D = c("index", "lcomp", "agecomp")),
  user_recdevs = NULL, parallel = FALSE, parallel_iterations = FALSE,
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{iterations}{Which iterations to run. A numeric vector. For example
\code{1:100}.}

\item{scenarios}{Which scenarios to run. A vector of character objects. For
example \code{c("D0-F0-cod", "D1-F1-cod")}. Also, see
\code{\link{expand_scenarios}} for a shortcut to specifying the scenarios.
See \code{\link{get_caseargs}} and the vignette for details on specifying
the scenarios.}

\item{case_folder}{The folder containing the plain-text case files.}

\item{om_dir}{The folder containing the SS3 operating model
configuration files.}

\item{em_dir}{The folder containing the SS3 estimation model
configuration files.}

\item{case_files}{A named list that relates the case IDs to the files to
return. \bold{The default list specifies only the required fishing
mortality and data scenarios. To specify other cases you will need to
extend this named list}. This argument is passed to
\code{\link{get_caseargs}}. See that function for details and examples of
how to specify this. The introduction vignette also explains how to specify
the case files.}

\item{user_recdevs}{An optional matrix of recruitment deviations to replace
the recruitment deviations built into the package. The columns represent
run iterations and the rows represent years. \code{user_recdevs} can be a
matrix of 0s for deterministic model checking. For traditional stochastic
simulations these would be independent and normally distributed deviations
with a standard deviation equal to the desired sigma R. Note that these
recruitment deviations will be used verbatim (after exponentiation).
\code{user_recdevs} will *not* be multiplied by sigma R and they will *not*
be log-normal bias corrected. If \code{user_recdevs} are specified as
anything besides \code{NULL} the package will issue a warning about this.
Biased recruitment deviations can lead to biased model results.}

\item{parallel}{A logical argument that controls whether the scenarios are
run in parallel. You will need to register multiple cores first with a
package such as \pkg{doParallel} and have the \pkg{foreach} package
installed. See the example below.}

\item{parallel_iterations}{Logical. By default \code{parallel = TRUE} will
run scenarios in parallel. If you set \code{parallel = TRUE} and
\code{parallel_iterations = TRUE} then the iterations will be run in
parallel. This would be useful if you were only running one scenario
but you wanted to run it faster.}

\item{...}{Anything else to pass to \code{\link{ss3sim_base}}. This could
include \code{bias_adjust} and \code{bias_nsim}. Also, you can pass
additional options to the \code{SS3} command through the argument
\code{admb_options}.}
}
\value{
The output will appear in whatever your current \R working directory
is. There will be folders named after your scenarios. They will
look like this:
\itemize{
\item \code{D0-F0-cod/bias/1/om}
\item \code{D0-F0-cod/bias/1/em}
\item \code{D0-F0-cod/bias/2/om}
\item ...
\item \code{D0-F0-cod/1/om}
\item \code{D0-F0-cod/1/em}
\item \code{D0-F0-cod/2/om}
\item ...
}
}
\description{
This is the main high-level wrapper function for running \pkg{ss3sim}
simulations. This function first deals with parsing a scenario ID into case
arguments, reads the appropriate case files, and then passes these arguments
on to \code{\link{ss3sim_base}} to run a simulation. Alternatively, you might
choose to run \code{\link{ss3sim_base}} directly and skip the case-file
setup.
}
\details{
The operating model folder should contain: \code{forecast.ss},
\code{yourmodel.ctl}, \code{yourmodel.dat}, \code{ss3.par}, and
\code{starter.ss}. The files should be the versions that are returned from an
SS run as \code{.ss_new} files. This is important because it creates
consistent formatting which many of the functions in this package depend on.
Rename the \code{.ss_new} files as listed above (and in all lowercase). The
estimation model folder should contain all the same files listed above except
the \code{ss3.par} and \code{yourmodel.dat} files, which are unnecessary but
can be included if desired. See the vignette for details on modifying an
existing \code{SS3} model to run with \pkg{ss3sim}. Alternatively, you might
consider modifying one of the built-in model configurations.
