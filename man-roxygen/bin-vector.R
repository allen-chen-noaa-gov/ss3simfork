#' @param bin_vector A numeric vector giving the desired bin structure. This
#' argument does not affect this sampling function itself. Instead, it is here
#' so it can be passed on to \code{\link{change_data}} from within
#' \code{\link{ss3sim_base}}. If left as \code{NULL} then the bins will not be
#' altered from what is in the SS3 operating model \code{.dat} file.
