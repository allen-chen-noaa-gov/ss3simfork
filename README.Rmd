# ss3simfork

This is a fork of the ss3sim package that incorporates a spatial economic 
model, testing the use of corrected fishery-dependent abundance indices.

Please refer to the [ss3sim Github](https://github.com/ss3sim/ss3sim) for 
documentation and the original repository. This readme outlines changes to that 
original repository.

## Where the economic model interacts with ss3sim

The primary interaction the economic model has with ss3sim is to potentially 
add an additional abundance index to the estimating model. During a standard 
run, ss3sim produces a "true" abundance index by year in its operating model. 
The economic model then takes that true abundance and distributes it across a 
spatial grid as defined by the analyst. Then in each year fishers sample across 
the spatial grid depending on some specified sampling pattern, and those 
samples are used to construct an estimate of abundance in that year. This index 
can then be used in the estimating model.

## Running the model

Running the model is largely the same as before. A reproducible script is 
included below. The ggplot2, RColorBrewer, plyr, doParallel, and foreach 
packages can be found on CRAN. Please get ss3simfork and [barebones.FishSET](https://github.com/allen-chen-noaa-gov/barebones.FishSET) 
from their respective Github repositories.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
#this assumes you've set the directory to wherever you've downloaded the 
#packages
install.packages(c("barebones.FishSET", "ss3simfork"))
```

The first three packages run the model, and the latter two are just for making 
the plots.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#for running the model
library(ss3simfork)
library(doParallel)
library(foreach)

#for making the plots
library(plyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(RColorBrewer)
```

We use the "cod-like" species that is in the ss3sim package. We also set two
directories, one where we put the cases, and the other where the raw output is 
written. You could choose the same directory if you wanted.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
d <- system.file("extdata", package = "ss3simfork")
om <- paste0(d, "/models/cod-om")
em <- paste0(d, "/models/cod-em")

#rawoutputdir for files (iterations and scenarios)
rawoutputdir <- #enter your preferred directory here

#nicedir for cases
nicedir <- #enter your preferred directory here; a folder eg-cases should be
    #in this directory containing the case files.
case_folder <- paste0(nicedir, "\\eg-cases")
```

The primary difference is that there is an extra "econ" case file in the
eg-cases folder now. The example cases below can be found in the 
inst\\extdata\\econ\\eg-cases folder in the package, to be copied into the 
directory you chose above.

An example econ case file is shown below. The econ case file specifies the 
economic model and sampling process in `functionname`. There are currently four 
options: 
1) `nodata` adds no additional data, 
2) `moredatabias` allows fishers to sample based on their preferences, and 
uses those samples to construct abundance indices without correction,
3) `moredatasample` has fishers randomly sample a location, not based on their 
preferences, and uses those samples to construct abundance indices, and
4) `moredatadahl` has fishers sample based on their preferences, but uses those 
samples in a process correcting for selection bias, creating abundance indices. 

A matrix describing the distances to each respective location in the spatial
grid is specified in `locnum`. Then, `obsnum` describes the number of 
observations simulated at each location, `betavar` the parameters dictating 
average catches at each location, and `uparams` the utility function parameters 
describing the fisher's preferences. If you specify a file name, abundance 
indices will be written to the specified folder and name, ending in the ss3sim 
iteration number. Otherwise it will be written to each ss3sim iteration folder.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
functionname; nodata
locnum; rbind(c(0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.707), c(0.5, 0.0, 0.707, 0.5), c(0.5, 0.707, 0, 0.5), c(0.707, 0.5, 0.5, 0))*3
obsnum; 500
betavar; c(1.50, 1.25, 1.00, 0.75)
uparams; list(alpha = 3, betac = -1)
abundse; NULL
abundscale; NULL
filename; NULL
```

This case file then gets used in the run_ss3sim call. 

You should check how many workers your machine can use. With 8 workers it 
took about 2 days.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#This is directory where RAW output get written
setwd(rawoutputdir) 

#The current directory when you register parallel cores is the directory output 
#gets written
registerDoParallel(cores = #8) 

print(Sys.time())
begtime <- Sys.time()

run_ss3sim(iterations = 1:100, scenarios =
     c(
    "D1-E1-F2-M0-cod", 
    "D2-E1-F2-M0-cod", 
    "D3-E1-F2-M0-cod", 
    "D4-E1-F2-M0-cod"
     ),
  case_files = list(F = "F", D = c("index", "lcomp", "agecomp", "econ"),
    E = "E", M = "M"),
  case_folder = case_folder, om_dir = om,
  em_dir = em, bias_adjust = FALSE, parallel = TRUE, parallel_iterations = TRUE)
#I thought I remembered something about a problem with bias_adjust?
  
endtime <- Sys.time()
print(Sys.time())

endtime - begtime
```
The operating model runs the same as before. Now, during the estimating model, 
in `ss3sim_base`, there is an additional `sample_econ` call that runs the 
function specified in the econ case file. As part of this process the 
`spatial_fishery` function takes the abundance in each year and distributes it 
according to the `betavar` parameters across the designated spatial grid. Then, 
depending on the sampling process specified, an index of abundance is 
estimated.

## Some results

Using the function from the ss3sim package, we can grab aggregated results 
`scalar_dat` and `ts_dat`. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
get_results_all(directory = rawoutputdir, 
    overwrite_files = TRUE, 						
    #this writes to rawoutputdir even if you set a nicedir before call
    user_scenarios = 
    c(    
    "D1-E1-F2-M0-cod", 
    "D2-E1-F2-M0-cod", 
    "D3-E1-F2-M0-cod", 
    "D4-E1-F2-M0-cod"
    ), 
    parallel = TRUE)
		
scalar_dat <- read.csv("ss3sim_scalar.csv")
ts_dat <- read.csv("ss3sim_ts.csv")

ts_dat$SpawnBio <- (SpawnBio_em - SpawnBio_om)/SpawnBio_om)
  
ts_dat <- merge(ts_dat, scalar_dat[,c("scenario", "replicate",
    "max_grad")])

subsetlist <- c("D1","D2","D3","D4")

ts_dat_sto <- subset(ts_dat, D %in% subsetlist)

ts_dat_sto$D <- as.factor(ts_dat_sto$D)

ts_dat_sto$D <- revalue(ts_dat_sto$D, c(
    "D1"="Quadrennial fishery-independent survey",
    "D2"="+ Annual randomly-sampled fishery data",
    "D3"="+ Annual uncorrected fishery data",
    "D4"="+ Annual corrected fishery data"))
    
#Small values of the maximum gradient (approximately 0.001 or less) indicate 
#that model convergence is likely. 
#Larger values (greater than 1) indicate that model convergence is unlikely. 
ts_dat_sto <- ts_dat_sto[ts_dat_sto$max_grad<1,] 

test.50 <- ddply(ts_dat_sto, .(E,year), summarise, 
    five0 = quantile(SpawnBio, probs = c(0.5), na.rm = TRUE))

We can also look at the relative abundance indices across different sampling 
patterns.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

#The default naming convention for each abundance index .csv is below, if 
the file name is left NULL, but can be specified if desired.

    list(Year = totabundout$year, Index = totabundout$Index), median)

## Next steps

The way the econ case files are set up there are a few places to expand the
analysis in a fairly straightforward manner.  

1) Include more locations for robustness. This only involves editing the 
distance matrix and betavar. Likely 9 or 12 locations as long as this seems 
sufficient, because run time gets imposing (if one run of the economic model 
takes one hour, but for each year, and each iteration, that's 2600 hours 
divided by the number of workers avaiable).  

2) Randomize or add a spatial trend to the betavar. Currently they're static. 
We could randomize the locations so some locations have greater catches in some 
years, but not others. Or, have fish moving northward during the time period. I 
expect the economic model to still work fairly well actually, until we...  

3) Change the number of chosen observations at locations. There are likely two 
different ways to do so. The first is to just have some locations with very few 
or no starting observations (a fisher starts in a location, then gets to choose 
where to go). The `obsnum` variable in the econ case file can currently take a 
vector of length equal to the number of locations. Or, we can also try and 
change the fisher utility parameters to for example find travel very costly. 
Then vessels may not travel to some locations (as long as none were seeded 
there).  

4) In general while doing these robustness checks, it would be good to get 
input and think about what real-world fisheries these examples are most 
relevant to. And, we can complicate the way catches are modeled, or abundance 
is distributed spatially, if things seem too simplified.
